Meal Planner Project:

Description:

This is my fourth project I made for an API project. I used the mealDB Api for this project. For this project I just made it to where if you want to search for a certain food, lets say chicken, all you have to do is type chicken in the search box and all items that deals with chicken will then appear for you. Followed by an image and instructions on how to cook the food. Very simple and basic project to show that I know how to make calls to display the information to the webpage.
